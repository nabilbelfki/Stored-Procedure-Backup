# Project Title
This project provides scripts for backing up and importing MySQL stored procedures.

# Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on how to use the scripts for backing up and importing MySQL stored procedures.

## Prerequisites
* MySQL Server
* PHP
* Bash Shell
## Configuration
Before running the scripts, you need to update the `config.sh` file with your database credentials and other configuration details. Open the `config.sh` file in a text editor and update the following lines:

```
username="your_username"
password="your_password"
database="your_database"
```
Replace `"your_username"`, `"your_password"`, and `"your_database"` with your actual MySQL username, password, and database name.

# Usage
## Backup Stored Procedures
To backup your stored procedures, run the `backup.sh` script from the terminal:

```
./backup.sh
```

This script will create a backup of all stored procedures in the specified database and save them as `.sql` files in the `/stored-procedures` directory.

## Import Stored Procedures
If you want to import the stored procedures into another database, you can use the `import.sh` script. Before running the script, make sure to update the `config.sh` file with the credentials of the database where you want to import the stored procedures. Then, run the following command in the terminal:

```
./import.sh
```

This script will import all stored procedures from the `.sql` files in the `/stored-procedures` directory into the specified database.
